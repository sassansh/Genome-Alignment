## Technology Stack 🛠️

[Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Prerequisites 🍪

You should have [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Java SDK](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your PC, however this project was stored and run on [UBC CS Department Unix servers](https://my.cs.ubc.ca/docs/connecting-department-unix-servers) which have all needed tools installed.

## Setup And Deployment 🔧

1. Clone the repo using:

   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/sassansh/Genome-Alignment.git
   ```

2. Run the following bash command:

   ```bash
   ./run_tests_genome_alignment.sh
   ```

   Running it on UBC Unix Servers:
